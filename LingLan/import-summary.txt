ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => social_sdk_library_project\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => social_sdk_library_project\src\main\assets
* libs\bolts-android-1.1.4.jar => social_sdk_library_project\libs\bolts-android-1.1.4.jar
* libs\httpmime-4.1.3.jar => social_sdk_library_project\libs\httpmime-4.1.3.jar
* libs\SocialSDK_Sina.jar => social_sdk_library_project\libs\SocialSDK_Sina.jar
* libs\SocialSDK_WeiXin_1.jar => social_sdk_library_project\libs\SocialSDK_WeiXin_1.jar
* libs\SocialSDK_WeiXin_2.jar => social_sdk_library_project\libs\SocialSDK_WeiXin_2.jar
* libs\umeng_social_sdk.jar => social_sdk_library_project\libs\umeng_social_sdk.jar
* lint.xml => social_sdk_library_project\lint.xml
* res\ => social_sdk_library_project\src\main\res\
* src\ => social_sdk_library_project\src\main\java

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
